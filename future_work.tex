\chapter{Future work}
\label{future_work}

What has to be done now.

translation of BLESS state machine

The semantics of BLESS contain notions of time that make translation to SPARK difficult.

translations for SPARK 2014 (for now, thread -> task translation can be done in Ada 2012 and then Sparking Ada)

try to apply generics on types translation

try to apply child packages for feature groups

Translator:
* it should ignore all not defined properties in data types translations
