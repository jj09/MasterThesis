\chapter{Future work}
\label{future_work}

What has to be done now.

translation of BLESS state machine (issue: time notion):
	* states
	* transitions

The semantics of BLESS contain notions of time that make translation to SPARK difficult.

translations for SPARK 2014 (for now, thread -> task translation can be done in Ada 2012 and then Sparking Ada)

try to apply generics on types translation

try to apply child packages for feature 

extend property set translation (only aadlinteger and simple types are handled)

Translator:
* it should ignore all not defined properties in data types translations

Decompose code (get rid of 1 big/huge package):
* separate packages
* child packages?
* maybe every thread should be in child package?

PCA Pump:
* Interface to ICE
* drug concentration
* monitoring of infused drug by sensors
