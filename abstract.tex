The future of Medical Devices is their interoperability. Nowadays, medical devices works rather independently, which cause accidents we could avoid if different devices would be able to communicate. Dr. Julian Goldman developed idea of "Integrated Clinical Environment" (ICE). It is series of standards, which describes medical device interoperability. SAnToS lab created Medical Device Coordination Framework (MDCF), which is implementation of ICE idea.

Ada is one of the most popular (along with C/C++) programming language targeted at embedded and real-time systems. SPARK Ada is subset of Ada, designed for the development of safety and security critical systems. It contains properties, which allows to prove correctness of program and its entities.

AADL (Architecture Analysis \& Design Language) is modeling language for representing hardware and software. It is used for real-time, safety critical and embedded systems. AADL allows for the description of both software and hardware parts of a system. It is used to describe architecture, but AADL it allows behavioral extensions through annex languages. BLESS (Behavior Language for Embedded Systems with Software) is AADL annex sub language defining behavior of components. The goal of BLESS is automatically-checked correctness proofs of AADL models of embedded electronic systems with software.

Nowadays, there is a trend to generate code from models. The ultimate goal of research, which this thesis if part of, is to create AADL/BLESS to SPARK Ada translator. Ultimately there will be standardized AADL/BLESS models, from which SPARK Ada code base will be generated. It will be starting point for developers, who will implement and extend it.

This thesis propose mapping from AADL/BLESS to SPARK Ada. As an example of Medical Device, PCA (Patient Controlled Analgesia) Pump is used. The foundation for this work is System Requirements for "Integrated Clinical Environment Patient-Controlled Analgesia Infusion Pump System Requirements" (DRAFT 0.10.1) \cite{PcaReq} and AADL Models with BLESS annexes created by Brian Larson. Additionally PCA Pump prototype was created. As a platform for prototyping, BeagleBoard-xM device was used.
