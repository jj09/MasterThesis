I would like to say thank you to all people, who helped me pursue Master of Science program in Computer Science at Kansas State University. Many thanks to Dr. Andrew Rys who encourage me to apply for Graduate School, and was always helpful with an advice. I wish to thank, my major professor, Dr. John Hatcliff who admitted me to SAnToS Laboratory research group, and enabled me to be involved in research. I met there many passionate people and great researchers. Furthermore, without Dr. Hatcliff's guidance, this thesis will not be accomplished. Thanks to Dr. Robby, who was always helping me in my research, giving valuable suggestions and ideas. Thank you to Jason Belt for sharing his knowledge and experience with me, which played significant role in my research career. Thanks to Brian Larson, whose work, was inspiration of my Master thesis. Thank you for Dr. Eugene Vasserman for serving on my committee and for his valuable suggestions about this work. A special thanks for Venkatesh Prasad Ranganath. Conversations with him and his suggestions played significant role in accomplishing this thesis.
