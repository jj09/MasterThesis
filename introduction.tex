\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

The tale about software safety: why important, software everywhere, human life, etc. (info from 890).

\

\section{Motivation}
\label{introduction:motivation}
Why we need this model driven development.
Model driven development in this case means we will have some base models for medical devices development and developer will extend and customize them. The same like you do File->New project in Java, we want to be able to do the same in e.g. GNAT Programming Studio: File->New Medical device project.
Why AADL?
Why SPARK? Because is subset, which is easy to deal with it. In the future, when everything will be done (in case of proving perspective) in SPARK, it will (probably) be extended. Maybe finally, there will be no SPARK, but only Ada. Thus for now, SPARK is temporary subset of Ada for reasoning and corectness proving.

\section{Contribution}
\label{introduction:contribution}
Put all piecies together (SPARK, AADL, BLESS?, ICE, PCA Pump)

\section{Organization}
\label{introduction:organization}
How many chapters etc.
