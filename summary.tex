What I have done.

The work is done for SPARK 2005. SPARK 2014 (especially taking) and its tools (such as gnatPROVE) were not ready at the time, when this thesis was written.

The biggest challenge during PCA pump development was the SPARK limitations. There are many common libraries, which cannot be verified by SPARK tools. Thus it is required to isolate some functionalities or implement them in different way.

Issues:

- not many online resources
- no access to industry code
- everything (AADL, SPARK2014, BLESS, tools) is under development
- hard to create running application
- need to rely on some resources, which are not nessesarly up to date
- AADL models don't contains subprograms, which would be useful in AADL2SPARK translator creation
