What I have done.

The work is done for SPARK 2005. SPARK 2014 (especially taking) and its tools (such as gnatPROVE) were not ready at the time, when this thesis was written.

Issues:

- not many online resources
- no access to industry code
- everything (AADL, SPARK2014, BLESS, tools) is under development
- hard to create running application
- need to rely on some resources, which are not nessesarly up to date
- AADL models don't contains subprograms, which would be useful in AADL2SPARK translator creation
